I read somewhere that a good programmer can write a simple tetris program in about 2-hours. 
This took me about six-weeks off and on. I guess I'm not that good a programmer. 

But it works with Python 2.6 or greater (but not 3.0) and the default TK GUI library, so it doesn't need extra python libraries,
which is nice.
